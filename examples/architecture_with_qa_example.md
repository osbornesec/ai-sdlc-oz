# System Architecture: Microservice Y

## 1. Overview
Microservice Y is responsible for handling user authentication and authorization. It exposes a set of RESTful APIs for other services to consume.

## 2. Key Components

*   **API Gateway:** All incoming requests are routed through the API Gateway, which handles request validation and rate limiting.
*   **Authentication Service:** This service manages user credentials and token generation. It uses JWT for session management.
*   **Authorization Service:** This service checks user permissions against requested resources.
*   **User Database:** Stores user profiles and credentials securely. We will be using PostgreSQL with encryption at rest.

The system will also incorporate a **reverse proxy** to manage SSL termination and provide an additional layer of security.

```ai-qa
AI: The term 'reverse proxy' is mentioned. Would you like a brief explanation of its role in this system?
User: Yes, please.
AI: In this specific architecture, the reverse proxy will sit in front of the API Gateway. Its main roles will be SSL/TLS termination (decrypting HTTPS requests and encrypting responses), potentially caching static content if applicable, and providing an additional security buffer by hiding the internal network topology.
